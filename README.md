# Todo App

Generic intro project that handles CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations for your own checklist.

You can use it without registering as all entries are stored locally by default.
When you create an account, your data will persist using a CockroachDB database cluster.

This app showcases familiarity with the following:
- ESLint
- TypeScript
- React
- NextJS
- Tailwind CSS
- RPC via oRPC
- Auth via Next Auth
